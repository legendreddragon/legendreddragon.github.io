# Level 10
{: .no_toc }

The tenth level of the game is often seen as the worst in the game. The Forest Monsters are very difficult and the Gold yield is low. Most competitive Players will skip Level 10.

## Master

Gandalf is the Level 10 master. He is most commonly fought with a Wan's Weapon and Full Body Armour, however it's still only a 50% chance. The risk is worth it, however, as saving for a Spear of Gold and Blood Armour will take longer than failing to beat Gandalf a few times.

## Equipment

Level 10 is very difficult with a Wan's Weapon and Full Body Armour. You would probably need to have a Crystal Shard and Magic Protection to make a decent amount of Gold on Level 10.

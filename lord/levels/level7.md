# Level 7

The seventh level of the game is sometimes skipped by competitive players. The monsters are very difficult and have a low Gold yield. The only good reason to stay in Level 7 is if you want to get a very good Level 8 kill.

## Equipment

Level 7 is survivable with a Power Axe and Armour of Death. Anything less than this is difficult and you will have to tread very carefully in the Forest. Night Hawk, Goliath and Swiss Butcher are the most dangerous Forest Monsters.

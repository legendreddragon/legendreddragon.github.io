## Master

The Red Dragon is effectively the master of Level 12. 

## Equipment

Level 12 is survivable with a Wan's Weapon and Full Body Armour. You will need to pick how you fight however.  
  
Kal Torak, Humongous Black Wyre and The Wizard of Darkness are all killable.  
  
Black Unicorn and Mutated Black Widow are killable with Thieving Skills or Death Knight Skills.  
  
The Mighty Shadow and Black Warlock are generally not worth the effort, as their Gold yield is low.  
  
Cyclops Warrior is not to be attacked unless you have a Blood Sword.  
  
Corinthian Giant should never be fought in a competitve game.

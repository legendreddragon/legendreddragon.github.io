# Level 11
{: .no_toc }

The eleventh level of the game is full of difficult Forest Monsters and is hard to survive, even with high level Weapon and Armour. Most competitive Players will skip Level 11. Mostly because the level 11 is Hell.

## Equipment

Level 11 is very difficult with a Wan's Weapon and Full Body Armour. You would probably need to have a Crystal Shard and Magic Protection to make a decent amount of Gold on Level 11. Some Forest Monsters on Level 11 are difficult even with a Nira's Teeth.

## Master

Turgon is the Level 11 master. He is most commonly fought with a Wan's Weapon and Full Body Armour, however it's still only a 40% chance. The risk is worth it, however, as saving for a Spear of Gold and Blood Armour will take longer than failing to beat Turgon a few times.  
  
The problem happens when you die, get below 10 million XP and get stuck in the '11 Hell', without being able to challenge Turgon. So, saving up to 15 million XP may be a good idea before trying the jump to 12. That will give you a few days to try.

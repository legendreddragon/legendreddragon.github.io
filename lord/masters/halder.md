## Encountering Halder

This is the dialogue you see when you first go to the training center at level 1:
```
Hi there. Although I may not look muscular, I ain't all that weak. You cannot advance to another Master until you can best me in battle. I don't really have any advice except wear a groin cup at all times. I learned the hard way.
```

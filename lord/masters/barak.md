## Encountering Barak

This is the dialogue you see when you first go to the training center at level 2:
```
You are now level two, and a respected warrior.

Try talking to the Bartender, he will see you now. He is a worthy asset... Remember, your ultimate goal is to reach Ultimate Warrior status, which is level twelve.
```

## Questioning Barak

When you `(Q)uestion` your master to see if you have enough experience to level up, this is what you see if you can go ahead and challenge him/her:
```
You know, you are actually getting pretty good with that thing...
```

## Defeating Barak

Your odds of success depend on your weapon/armour combination.

Oh wait, no they don't, because Barak is a complete wuss. If you just defeated the Dragon, and you put the mere 10 gems you got as a reward in defense, you could face him with Fists and Nothing!.

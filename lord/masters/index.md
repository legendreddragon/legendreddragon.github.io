## Gameplay

There are eleven masters in Legend of the Red Dragon, one for each level you can master.  

To advance a level, you have to beat your master.  
  
When you reach level 12, The Red Dragon becomes "the master" you need to beat to reset your game to level 1.

Each Master has a different minimum XP requirement for you to be able to attack him (except for the Red Dragon).

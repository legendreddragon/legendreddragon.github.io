## Encountering Aladdin

This is the dialogue you see when you first go to the training center at level 8:

> You are now level eight. Remember, do not use your great strength in bullying the other warriors. Do not be a braggart. Be humble, and remember, honor is everything.
{: .game-citation }

## Questioning Aladdin

When you `(Q)uestion` your master to see if you have enough experience to level up, this is what you see if you can go ahead and challenge him/her:

> You REALLY know how to use your <weapon>!!! <-- Current Weapon
